Cypht 1.3.0
-----------

It has been 3 YEARS since we last offered a stable release and the
list of changes is gigantic. The detailed commit list is in the
CHANGES file. This release is stable, but not perfect. There are
known issues documented at Github. It is however light years ahead
of the last stable release and even with known issues far more
stable and superior in just about every way.

Many thanks to everyone supporting the project in any way they can.
Special thanks to the Tiki Wiki team for all the incredible help
they have provided (https://tiki.org/). This will be the first of
a more regular release schedule, at least more regular than every
3 years!
